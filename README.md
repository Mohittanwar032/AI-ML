# Logistic Regression - Breast Cancer Classification

This is my Task 4 submission for the AI & ML Internship.

## Goal
Use Logistic Regression to classify tumors as malignant or benign.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps
1. Loaded dataset
2. Preprocessed and scaled the data
3. Trained Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, ROC curve

## What I Learned
- How Logistic Regression works
- How to evaluate a binary classifier
- What sigmoid and ROC curve mean
